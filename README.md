# ML-Bootcamp

### 1. Linear Regression
a).Tried writing the mathematical code of gradient descent, by using matrices ( by numpy library), using for loops for iterations and for nested loop for calculating theta matrix in a single iteration.

b). Normalized the data to bring it into a single scale (0 to 1), cleaved the data into training and test sets by using the scikit library's
